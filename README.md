This repository contains Scripts and YAMLs used in [my article](https://blog.brakmic.com/keycloak-with-postgresql-ha-on-kubernetes/) on deploying Keycloak with PostgreSQL-HA on k8s.

Check this [HOWTO](./howtos/HOWTO.md) on how to deploy everything.

There is also a bash [script](./scripts/run_kc_system.sh) available that can automate the whole process.
